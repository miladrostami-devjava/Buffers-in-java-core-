Explanation of the Code:
Import Statements: The necessary classes are imported: FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, IOException, and FileChannel.

File Paths: Two string variables, inputFile and outputFile, are defined. These represent the paths of the input and output files, respectively.

Try-with-Resources: This is used to automatically close resources (FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, and FileChannel) after the block is executed. This ensures that resources are properly released, preventing potential resource leaks.

getChannel() method is called on these streams to
